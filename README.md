## ü§® What is it?

GitForest is a dynamic, visually driven GitHub profile enhancement that
turns your contribution history into a forest. The more you code, the
bigger the forest grows. The forest will be periodically reset to prevent
the forest from becoming to large however the data (how many forests you've
filled) will be stored and displayed. GitForest helps you visualize
consistency, progress and growth in a more organic, motivating and fun
way.

### ‚ú® Features

 - üå≥ **Visual growth:** When you contribute more you see trees grow 
and new elements appear as the ecosystem grows
 - üìà **Progress tracker:** See how many forests you've filled over time
 - üõ†Ô∏è **GitHub integration:** Works directly with your contribution data
